To be clear. The content here is a content based on a free course. Noone can reproduce this material. If you wanna to know this material, my advice is to you access the **free** [course](https://web.dio.me/track/coding-the-future-claro-java-spring-boot). And if they end the course or start to ask money to study in the course? Well, this considerations are out of my control, but the DIO material is excelent and the course is amazing! If you acquire a DIO paln, you will have access to amazing courses.


# General

I developed the content of this repository (except this file) with the command `mvn-ask-parameters` who allowed me to reach the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.5
```

After creating the basic project it was possible to use the following command as example:

```
mvn test
```
