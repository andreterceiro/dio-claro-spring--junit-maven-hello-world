# General

I developed the content of this repository (except this file) with the command `mvn-ask-parameters` who allowed me to reach the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.5
```

After creating the basic project it was possible to use the following command as example:

```
mvn test
```
